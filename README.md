# Machine Learning Coursework

For this coursework, we were tasked to do analysis consisting of three parts, using 3 different datasets for each question.

1. In the first part, we were given the 2016 European Working Conditions Survey(EWCS) data set, collected from various individuals on several variables. The goal will be to use unsupervised learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis or Cluster Analysis to summarise the information in the data by appropriate tables and/or plots.

2. In the second part, we were given the student performance data set by Paulo Cortez, University of Minho, Guimaraes, Portugal. This data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features) and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The task is to build a regression model for the variable G3 (final grade) without using the variables G1 and G2.

3. Finally, in the third part, we were given a data set from the direct marking campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution and tasked to build a classification model to predict if the client will subscirbe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).
